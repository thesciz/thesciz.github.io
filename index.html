      <h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>A deep, pulsing hum begins to emanate from the dark tower; around you, the inferno begins to intensify. The wind suddenly picks up, feeding the eager flames. Kram’s colossal bulk sits motionless, like a big sad bearded hill in the midst of pandemonium. The bees are on fire. Kram is on fire. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble, then shake violently; the winds tear back the ceiling of black smoke above, and you behold a sky filled with glowing, fiery streaks; the heavens themselves seem to be coming apart. The noise is all-consuming; it fills you - it becomes you. Your gaze is drawn back to the Obelisk; it has grown to thrice it’s height, reaching up towards the rending skies; the earth surrounding it crumbles and falls into a yawning abyss; then, at once, silence. The fires have gone; the sky is still; the obelisk, that beacon of terror and salvation, has vanished.</p>
      <p>All is as it was; a pale dawn rises in the east.</p>
      <p>Beneath where the obelisk had stood, a softly glinting light catches your eye; a patch of frost clings to the packed earth. At its center sits a small, black orb.</p>
      <p>You quickly find that the orb cannot be held with bare hands - it’s impossibly cold. It’s seemingly impervious to harm, and no magic affects it. It’s heavier than it has any right to be for it’s roughly 1-inch diameter, and it’s utterly featureless. </p>
      <p>The dream and the orb gnaw at your mind. You ask around Phandalin, furtively, casually, and learn nothing of great value - other than this: Sildar recalled a tale, half-remembered from his youth, of some fel spellcraft that read thoughts from afar, and invoked vivid, violent dreams. He remembers little, other than it being told in hushed and serious tones by Dwarves of the Gate, visiting Neverwinter from across the Andorian sea.</p>
      <p>The party books passage on a merchant vessel and, days later, sails into the west.</p>
