      <h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>A deep, pulsing hum begins to emanate from the dark tower; around you, the inferno begins to intensify. The wind suddenly picks up, feeding the eager flames. Kram’s colossal bulk sits motionless, like a big sad bearded hill in the midst of pandemonium. The bees are on fire. Kram is on fire. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble, then shake violently; the winds tear back the ceiling of black smoke above, and you behold a sky filled with glowing, fiery streaks; the heavens themselves seem to be coming apart. The noise is all-consuming; it fills you - it becomes you. Your gaze is drawn back to the Obelisk; it has grown to thrice it’s height, reaching up towards the rending skies; the earth surrounding it crumbles and falls into a yawning abyss; then, at once, silence. The fires have gone; the sky is still; the obelisk, that beacon of terror and salvation, has vanished.</p>
      <p>All is as it was; a pale dawn rises in the east.</p>
      <p>Beneath where the obelisk had stood, a softly glinting light catches your eye; a patch of frost clings to the packed earth. At its center sits a small, black orb.</p>
      <p>You quickly find that the orb cannot be held with bare hands - it’s impossibly cold. It’s seemingly impervious to harm, and no magic affects it. It’s heavier than it has any right to be for it’s roughly 1-inch diameter, and it’s utterly featureless. </p>
      <p>The dream and the orb gnaw at your mind. You ask around Phandalin, furtively, casually, and learn nothing of great value - other than this: Sildar recalled a tale, half-remembered from his youth, of some fel spellcraft that read thoughts from afar, and invoked vivid, violent dreams. He remembers little, other than it being told in hushed and serious tones by Dwarves of the Gate, visiting Neverwinter from across the Andorian sea.</p>
      <p>The party books passage on a merchant vessel and, days later, sails into the west. You most definitely have the orb.</p>

      <h2>Session 1 - Coming Ashore</h2>
      <p>
        The party spoke with captain and crew, learning a bit about the land you were approaching; namely, 
        that times were troubled. Something was wrong with a river, <strong>Queen Ezmei</strong> of 
        <strong>Dawnmist</strong> was becoming irate, and things were generally unwell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crew disembarked, and the party followed their captian into the <strong>Saltbeak Inn</strong>
        as he sought the portmaster, <strong>Mara</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Xanveria</strong>, always so open and honest, asked Mara if she knew anything
        about dark, mysterious forces at work in area; Mara smiled, rushing off to conduct business, 
        telling Xanveria that they could talk later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeking a challenge, <strong>Loopi</strong> eyeballed and sat down with <strong>Burdock</strong>,
        an imposing half-orc who was sitting drinking and brooding in a corner. Loopi challenged
        Burdock to an arm wrestling match and was promptly thrown <i>through</i> the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        The innkeeper, <strong>Edwin</strong>, spoke with Xanveria about the state of things in the region;
        how the mighty Grey river had somehow turned foul, turning crops to blackened rot and
        causing those who drank too deeply to waste away. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Edwin explained that the <strong>Dwarves of the Gate</strong> (the Gatesmen (shut up Arthas; remember
        Gimli explaining the way of things to Eowyn? <i>It's true you don't see many dwarf women. 
        And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, that they are often mistaken for dwarf men!</i> ))
        had been sending regular supply convoys of provisions southwards through the <strong>Antilligan</strong> 
        and down to <strong>Dawnmist</strong> to help feed its peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, Edwin explained that the Antilligan had been largely deserted; the previously
        fertile region could no longer support the crops that had fed its inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having overheard Xanveria's quesiton to Mara, Burdock states that he may be able to 
        share some knowledge in exchange for the party's help. Burdock explains that he had been
        the leader of a group of mercenaries that were tasked with clearing some trouble out 
        of a small mining operation in <strong>The Dakk</strong>. For reasons he didn't elaborate
        on, the group turned on him, beat and robbed him and left him for dead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Burdock asks the group to obtain his <strong>chainmail shirt</strong> from the group,
        and wouldn't have any complaints if they dealt with his former companions as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party ventured north and arrived at The Dakk just after nightfall:
      </p>
      <p>
        <div class="exposition">
          You leave Dalesport by the eastern gate and begin your trek north, the Wolfsrun 
          forest stretching westward towards the frowning Irecrag hills. To the east, you 
          pass abandoned farms and sparse woodland; the day drags on, uneventful. At length, 
          the Wolfsrun bends off to the west, and the land grows more coarse; jagged, 
          slanted plateaus of rock jut from fields of heather as if the earth had been 
          rent by vengeful gods. A faint stench of rot begins to blow in on a gentle 
          southerly breeze. As the sun dips below the Irecrags, in the growing twilight, 
          you crest a low rise and behold The Dakk: sprawling out before you, to the distant 
          peaks of mountains draped in shadow, is the vast mire of rot that is the Queensbog,
          wreathed in mist punctured by the leafless trunks of decaying trees. 
          The path runs north for another hundred yards to the precipice of a low cliff, 
          and ends abruptly. Near the edge, cookfires and lanterns faintly illuminate a 
          small encampment.
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        The party approached and introduced themselves to the dwarves (and a couple elves)
        that were manning the outpost. Arthas spoke at length with Banu, one of the more 
        seasoned veterans. He learned that Banu was there with the <strong>Clerics of the Gate</strong>,
        the clerics guild of the dwarven kingdom; the elves were sent from Dawnmist to, ostensibly, 
        "assist" with the investigation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu explained some history of The Dakk: that it had once been a verdant forest, home
        to a palatial coastal city of dwarves and elves. A cataclysmic explosion of mysterious
        origin some two hundred years ago caused hundreds of square kilometers of land to slide partially
        into the Queensbay, inundating the now sunken forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legend suggests that a wizard named Miersmo Dinbrook, who vanished after the explosion,
        was responsible, causing the event to be referred to as Dinbrook's Foul-up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu also explained how The Dakk wasn't an ordinary bog; that soon after the foul-up 
        the land darkened and was overtaken by an unnatural, unholy rot that has yet to be explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu and his clerics are there to find some connection between The Dakk and the rot
        that has set into the Grey.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a night of moderate drinking, the party descends into the Dakk and follows the dwarves 
        rough directions to <strong>Bensfarr Mine</strong>, dug into the exposed sheer cliff face
        of the western border.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exterior looked like a battleground; rotting hobgoblin skulls sat impaled on pikes surrounding the entrance; sharpened sticks and other defensive hazards were arrayed in a semicircle leading up to the cave mouth; and a score of orc and half-or corpses were strewn about in various states of charred disassembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party entered the mine and descendeded a shaft using handholds that had been roughly
        hewn into the stone.

      <h2>Sessions 2 - Gheen the Beholder (and an ashy surprise)</h2>
      <p>
        The party quickly discover a cavernous space occupied by a sleeping beholder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without wasting much time, Fugazi put an arrow into it's eye, instigating a violent fight to the death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tragically, it is here that Chapthanglas meets his end, when the lair itself came alive
        and cast him down with a disintegration ray, causing his body to turn to ash.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gheen finally falls, he wonders aloud at the party's intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party quickly finds <strong>Burdock's</strong> chainmail shirt, and a small, ornate
        dagger. The pommel is engraved with a pattern that Kram vaguely recognizes as the sigil of the <strong>Orvothian</strong>, but
        recalls nothing other than the name.
      </p>

      <h2>Session 3 - There's no place like Gnome</h2>
      <p>
        Deciding to return Burdock's chainmail, the party exits the mine only to discover <strong>Banu</strong>
        waiting for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu explains that their little dance with Gheen had caused some 'disturbances' that
        hadn't gone unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu says that he can be of some assistance in recovering Chapthanglas's spirit, but his body is likely lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        He goes on to explain that the elves at the camp would have likely taken notice of the 
        oddities caused by the Beholder fight and, piecing together that the newcomers were likely
        of a formidable disposition, would most certainly be off to flag down a patrol to assist in 
        the party's apprehension (the queen being unable to abide by the free travel of a group such as this).
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu states that he will help the group recover Chapthanglas (in some form), and use his 
        political clout (what's left of it) to ensure they are able to travel freely. In exchange,
        the group will help Banu and his clerics uncover and, if necessary, destroy the source of dark power that they have
        deduced is somewhere in the northeastern Dakk.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the party agrees, Banu conducts a reincarnation ritual, conjuring a female gnome 
        body for Chapthanglas to inhabit. The ritual is a, uh, success.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the group attempts to set off, Banu stops them and explains that their travels would be
        hindered by the Bogwolves; a wildly aggressive species that prevents travel into the northeast
        and descends in droves upon anyone who remains in The Dakk after dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banu suggests that one solution to the Bogwolf problem may reside at the <strong>Broken Tower</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believed to have once housed ye ol' Dinbrook, the tower is now inhabited by Ogres who appear
        to be the only beings the Bogwolves permit to live in The Dakk; if there is a way to placate
        the wolves, the ogres may hold the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        A short trek north later, the group comes upon the tower. Fugazi moves north to investigate and is quickly
        attacked by two ogres sitting near a cookfire outside of the tower. After a short and violent fight,
        the ogres lay dead. From their bodies, the group recover four crudely constructed <strong>pendants</strong>.
        Each pendant consists of a soft metal backing that has had a fragment of a dull green gemstone 
        hammered into it. When the pendants are removed from the corpses, the ogres seem to age and dessicate ever
        so slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploring the tower, <strong>Baart</strong>'s keen eyes uncover a peculiar brick set into the tower's 
        hearth; it's corners each bear a unique rune that appear to react (by slightly glowing) to the presence of the looted pendants.
        When all pendants are brought within close proximity, and all runes are lit, Loopi gives the brick
        a tickle, and the hearth rotates 90 degrees, revealing a hidden alcove.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within, the group uncovers a lockbox that is unlocked by the presence of the pendants. The lockbox contains
        a <strong>Bag of Holding</strong> and a leather bound book.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book is written in dwarvish script but in an unknown language; despite this, Banu concludes
        based on roughly drawn maps that his suspicions are correct: the northeast must be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Convinced that they cannot make it back to camp before nightfall, the group decides to 
        take shelter in the broken tower overnight. While keeping watch, Loopi and Fugazi 
        leave the confines of the tower, following Banu; they discover that the tower is surrounded;
        out of the darkness, hundreds of dully glowing eyes stare back at them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noticing that some of the beasts are dining on the ogre corpses, Loopi lunges at them wildly, and drives them back. 
        They seem to be responding to the presence of the pendant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhat satisfied that they'll be relatively safe, the group retires for the night.
